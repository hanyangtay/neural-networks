## Types of ML classifiers

Artifical neural networks

* Convolutional Neural Network (84.6%)

* Fully Connected Net (53.6%)


Linear Classifiers

* k-nearest Neighbour (27.8%)

* Multiclass Support Vector Machine (37.8%)

* Softmax Classifier (37.4%)




## Future Direction:

* Saving trained models using cPickle


# Refining artificial neural networks

* Nestarov momentum

* Xavier Initialisation

* Adadelta


# Recurrent neural networks

* LSTM

* Text Generation

* Music Generation


## Credits

The modular design of the neural networks and a huge part of the code, is from the [Stanford CS231n course](http://cs231n.github.io/).

I am deeply grateful to the Stanford team, who generously decided to make the course materials public. As somebody who tried to self-learn neural networks from other online tutorials, I really admire the way the course was structured and the pedagogical approach behind it. It was definitely difficult, but I learned so much. Highly recommended. Feel free to view my solutions [here](https://github.com/hanyangtay/CS231n-answers).
